# Project Title: SweetDreams

# Project Description

This project intends to provide a convenient, one-stop solution for parents to upload and explore lullabies for their children, and for children to play their parents' selected lullabies. This tool is made for parents and their young children, developed for a CS 346 project in Winter 2024. This app differes from other similar applications by adding an explore page linking lullabies from Youtube and publicly posted ones from other users. Core users will include parents who want to help their children sleep but are unavailable (busy, out of town, etc.).
