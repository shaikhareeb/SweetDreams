# Project Description

This project intends to provide a convenient, one-stop solution for parents to upload and explore lullabies for their children, and for children to play their parents' selected lullabies. This tool is made for parents and their young children, developed for a CS 346 project in Winter 2024. This app differes from other similar applications by adding an explore page linking lullabies from Youtube and publicly posted ones from other users. Core users will include parents who want to help their children sleep but are unavailable (busy, out of town, etc.).

# Essential Product Features

Platform: Desktop

1. Explore page for lullabies including public lullabies posted by other users
2. Explore page includes lullabies from Youtube via Youtube application (converted into audio)
3. Upload a lullaby audio (intended for parents, could be private or public)
4. View private lullabies made in the app (intended for children)
5. Add date, tag and intended use of lullabies for users to filter public lullabies.
6. Play audio in background as users can use other apps.
7. Add a child lock preventing app functionality that can only be unlocked via parental password.
8. Play lullabies automatically at certain times from a schedule if the app and laptop are open.
9. Lullabies stop playing after a specified lullaby timer
10. Lullabies can be put into playlists and played until the specified lullaby timer concludes.
