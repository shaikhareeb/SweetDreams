## Project Description

This project intends to provide a convenient, one-stop solution for parents to upload and explore lullabies for their children and for children to play their parents' selected lullabies. This app differs from similar applications by having an explore page linking lullabies from YouTube and publicly posted ones from other users. Core users will include parents who want to help their children sleep but are unavailable (busy, out of town, etc.).

## User Documentation

Start creating an account via 'Sign Up' on your first visit. Then, use the email/password for the account you created to attempt login. Videos from YouTube should be visible on the Explore page. Press “Play Video” to try and open these on your desktop browser directly as a link. These videos can serve as inspiration for your own lullabies. Now, go ahead and create your own lullabies on your recording app of choice, or store lullabies that you want to upload into SweetDreams locally. Next, go ahead to the 'Upload' page and try to upload some audio you want as a lullaby with an associated picture as a thumbnail. Note that the audio must be in .wav format, and the picture must be in .jpg format. 

Now, visit the 'User' page and see the lullabies you have uploaded that are associated with the account. Feel free to try to delete lullabies you do not like and add/remove the ones you want to play in the queue. Press “Play Queue” to try playing the first lullaby and “Stop Queue” to stop your queue. The audio control bar also includes buttons for play/pause for the current lullaby, skipping to the next track, or going back a track.

Once you are satisfied with the order of lullabies you wish to have your child fall asleep to, you can click on “Lock Application” to try entering child-lock mode. Here, the audio bar and navigation are disabled, and your child will have minimal distractions as they fall asleep to your lullabies safely. You can always try to unlock the application with your email and password. 

The settings offer some user information and account management features to try resetting your password or deleting your account if you wish. Press 'Log Out' to try and return to the signup/login page once you have finished your session. 

Thank you for using SweetDreams, and we hope you and your child have sweet dreams tonight.
