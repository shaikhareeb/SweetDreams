This project intends to provide a convenient, one-stop solution for parents to upload and explore lullabies for their children and for children to play their parents' selected lullabies. This app differs from similar applications by adding an explore page linking lullabies from YouTube and publicly posted ones from other users. Core users will include parents who want to help their children sleep but are unavailable (busy, out of town, etc.).
